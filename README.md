This assignment is for the [DAP Design & Implementatio For City of Vancouver](https://prathap-reddy-tyalla.github.io/Project-part-1/) project using the datasets taken from  website [City of Vancouver Open Data Portal](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/3-1-1-contact-centre-metrics/information/). This project concentrates on details of designing and implementing DAP in detail from scratch.

## Project Title: DAP Design & Implementation for 311 Contact Center of City of Vancouver
The City of Vancouver is increasingly leveraging data to improve its operations and services to citizens. This document outlines the implementation of an AWS Data Analytic Platform (DAP) designed to address the city's needs in various areas, including Animal control inventory register analysis, voting records analysis, 3-1-1 contact center analysis, and others. The DAP offers a secure, scalable, and cost-effective solution for data management, processing, and analysis, empowering city officials to make data-driven decisions for the benefit of Vancouver residents.
## Project Objective:
* Data Protection design and implementation.
* Data Governance design and implementation.

## Methodology:
* The process involves 3 different steps explained in detail below:
### Step1: Data Analytical Question Formulation
* In this dataset I will be using the 3-1-1 Contact center services. The main metric we will be suing here will be about “What is the count of Calls Abandoned for each month of the year respectively.” For calculating this we can use the ‘BI_ID’, ‘Calls_Abandoned’, ‘Date’ columns.
